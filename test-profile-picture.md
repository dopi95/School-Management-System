# Profile Picture Implementation Summary

## Changes Made:

### Backend (auth.js):
1. ✅ Added `profilePicture` field to login response
2. ✅ Added `profilePicture` field to profile update response  
3. ✅ Profile picture upload/remove endpoints already exist
4. ✅ Static file serving already configured in server.js

### Frontend:

#### AuthContext.jsx:
1. ✅ Added profile caching in localStorage during login
2. ✅ Profile picture included in cached data

#### Profile.jsx:
1. ✅ Updated profile picture URL construction
2. ✅ Proper error handling for image loading

#### Sidebar.jsx:
1. ✅ Updated profile picture display logic
2. ✅ Fixed show/hide logic for User icon fallback

## How it works:
1. When admin uploads profile picture, it's saved to `uploads/profiles/` directory
2. Backend serves static files from `/uploads` route
3. Profile picture path is stored in database and returned in all profile responses
4. Frontend constructs full URL: `http://localhost:5000/uploads/profiles/filename.jpg`
5. Profile data including picture is cached in localStorage
6. Picture persists across page refreshes and login sessions

## Testing:
1. Login to admin panel
2. Go to Profile page
3. Upload a profile picture
4. Refresh page - picture should remain
5. Logout and login again - picture should still be there
6. Check sidebar - picture should show there too
